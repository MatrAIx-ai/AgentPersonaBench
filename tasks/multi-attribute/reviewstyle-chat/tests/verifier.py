"""Multi-attribute adherence verifier — review style (chat env).

ONE written review from a SINGLE persona, three independent style checks:
  cog_emoji_use=Never      rule-based  -> zero emoji codepoints
  cog_formality=Slangy     llm-judge   -> casual, slangy register
  cog_verbosity=Rambling   llm-judge   -> long-winded, digressive

Task reward = integer score, one point per check HELD (0..N); per-check verdicts
in structured_output.json.

Input: OUTPUT_DIR/user_turns.json = {"turns":[...]} (the persona own messages)
