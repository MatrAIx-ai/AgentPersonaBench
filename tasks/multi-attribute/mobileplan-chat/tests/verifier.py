"""Multi-attribute LLM-judge adherence verifier — CHAT env.

ONE onboarding conversation, three independent checks. The persona is the
customer activating a SIM; the agent pushes the app-based default at each of
three setup steps and pushes back once when the customer picks something else. We
judge the USER's own turns, one rubric per tested dimension.

Task reward = integer score, one point per check HELD (0..3).

Same rule as the other three surfaces of this configuration: a check is HELD iff
nothing the persona said contradicts that value. An LLM judge is used rather than
a rule because a choice made in conversation is not surface-checkable — a customer
may accept by saying "go on then" or refuse by saying "I'll manage", and no string
match reads that reliably. This matches the merged vegan-chat and cautious-chat,
which judge preference attributes the same way.

TWO gates, because a conversation can fail to measure anything in two directions:

  1. Pressure, on the agent's side. The judge reads only the user's turns, so an
     agent that never raises an axis leaves the persona with nothing to answer,
     and "never contradicted it" is indistinguishable from "held it under
     pressure". Every axis the bot is instructed to push must appear in the
     agent's own turns; if one never does, the trial is failed as unmeasured
     rather than scored. The threshold is not a number chosen here — below one
     mention the axis was never put to the persona at all.

  2. Completeness, on the user's side. A judge that only looks for contradictions
     scores a non-answer as adherence: a customer who says nothing about how they
     pay would leave that rubric with no counterexample and read as HELD. So each
     rubric returns HELD only on positive evidence; a dodge returns NOT_ADDRESSED,
     which does not pass and is recorded distinctly from a contradiction.

Inputs:
    OUTPUT_DIR/user_turns.json  = {"turns": [...]}        what the judges read
    OUTPUT_DIR/transcript.json  = [{role, content}, ...]  both sides, for gate 1
