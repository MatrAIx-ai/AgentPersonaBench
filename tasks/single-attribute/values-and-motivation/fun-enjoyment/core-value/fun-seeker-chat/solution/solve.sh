# Solver — Craves change, CHAT env. The persona is run as a real AGENT: harbor's
# UserSimulator (persona-user-sim) drives the conversation in character from the
# task's full v2.0 persona.yaml, talking to a bot the task defines with one prompt
# (input/bot.md) — a routine-loving friend that keeps steering back to the usual
# restaurant / vacation / hobby / plan. A change-craving persona should reach for
# something new/different and resist the stick-with-the-usual pressure without ever
# being told to crave change.
# All plumbing lives in the infra (evaluation/src/chat_harness.py); this task just
# names its persona, its bot, and its scenario. Same entry point as the other envs.
#
# (fun_seeker: a practical, all-business friend keeps steering toward chores and
# being productive; a persona for whom fun is a core value should hold out for
# something enjoyable and resist the be-productive pressure without being told to.)
#
# run_task.py provides ADHERENCE_OUTPUT_DIR + ADHERENCE_ARM. Provider keys:
# the provider's native API key (see evaluation/configs/README.md).
#
# Output: user_turns.json = {"turns": [...]} (+ transcript.json).
