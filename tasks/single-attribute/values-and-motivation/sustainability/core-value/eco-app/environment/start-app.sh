# Bringup order on the docker_computer1 backend: this healthcheck runs FIRST,
# then the computer-1 runtime starts Xvfb on :1 + XFCE + Chromium (about:blank,
# raised last, and its liveness check requires Chromium — never kill it). So the
# healthcheck cannot draw anything yet: no X display exists, and the image sets
# no DISPLAY env. Everything display-dependent therefore lives in a background
# keeper that (a) waits for whatever X socket the runtime creates and resolves
# DISPLAY from it — never hardcode :0 — then (b) keeps HomeStock alive and
# raised above Chromium for the whole trial, so every agent screenshot shows the
# maximized app rather than the blank browser.
