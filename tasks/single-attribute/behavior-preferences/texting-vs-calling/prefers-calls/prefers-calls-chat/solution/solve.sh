# Prefers calls, CHAT env. The persona is run as a real AGENT: harbor's
# UserSimulator (persona-user-sim) drives the conversation in character from the
# task's full v2.0 persona.yaml, talking to a bot the task defines with one prompt
# (input/bot.md) — a text-only contact who keeps steering everything to text and
# async messaging and resists getting on a call. A persona that prefers calls
# should steer toward talking it through by phone/voice (ask to hop on a call, say
# it's easier live) without ever being told to prefer calls.
# All plumbing lives in the infra (evaluation/src/chat_harness.py); this task just
# names its persona, its bot, and its scenario. Same entry point as the other envs.
#
# run_task.py provides ADHERENCE_OUTPUT_DIR + ADHERENCE_ARM. Provider keys:
# the provider's native API key (see evaluation/configs/README.md).
#
# Output: user_turns.json = {"turns": [...]} (+ transcript.json).
