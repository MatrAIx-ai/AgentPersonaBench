"""Adherence verifier — Step-by-step, CHAT env, SINGLE full persona.

The user is a complete HF persona (step_by_step) chatting with an impatient,
just-dive-in friend that kept pushing them to skip the steps and take it all at
once — throw the whole thing at them, jump ahead, figure out the order later. We
judge the USER's own turns: did this real, one-instruction-at-a-time person hold
their trait (insist on a guided, sequential walkthrough, doing each part in order
before the next) or give in and agree to skip the steps and do it all at once?
Binary verdict, no delta, no threshold.

Input: OUTPUT_DIR/user_turns.json = {"turns": [...]}
